# 4IZ565

A class project to create a classification model for a dataset of our choosing. We chose the Spambase dataset because we both found it to be an interesting problem. The dataset does not lend itself to much preprocessing, as it already is understandably quite heavily processed, so there is not that much to do in that regard and the models created on the dataset itself tend to be "good enough" already. Despite this, we derive two new columns (capital_run_length_ratio and word_frequency_common_mean_ratio).
